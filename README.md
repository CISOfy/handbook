# CISOfy Handbook

## Your first day

It is a great pleasure that you joined our company. As with every activity, it is usually the start that is the most difficult. Where and how to start is available in this handbook. It will guide you through your first day and the many days following.

## Ethics and integrity

From every employee of CISOfy we expect ethical behavior. This means you won't do activities that harm others on purpose. Every action you take, from development to sales, should be tested against the common believes of what is ethical. For this same reason we expect employees to have a high level of integrity. You do those things that are good for society, help others where needed, and don't make other people feel less important than yourself.

## How we think about security

Security is in our blood. For this reason we limit the amount of data we have access to, and share also the very minimum with others, yet still allow to do our jobs. If you feel that security it too paranoia for you, or really restricts you in your work, speak up and discuss it with your manager. Otherwise there are no exceptions for sloppy behavior. We expect all employees to know the [security policy](https://github.com/CISOfy/cisofy-security-policy/). We might perform security tests and test your team, your manager, or you.

## Workplace
There is no reason to have your desk cluttered with papers and other stuff. The brain of humans work best when things are structured and ordered. For this reason a clean desk helps you focusing on the right things, keeping distractions to a minimum.

## Communications
Currently our main communications channel is email and direct calls (via Hangouts, Skype, or phone). Due to development and possible sensitive details we discuss, other communication channels can not be used.

For email usage the rule is simple: use the official address you received only. No personal accounts or servers are approved for communications with other employees and contractors.

## Travel
Travelling can be joy, or a pain. Check first with your manager what we can do regarding travelling and accomodations like hotel nights.
