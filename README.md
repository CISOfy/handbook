## Ethics and integrity

From every employee of CISOfy we expect ethical behavior. This means you won't do activities that harm others on purpose. Every action you take, from development to sales, should be tested against the common believes of what is ethical. For this same reason we expect employees to have a high level of integrity. You do those things that are good for society, help others where needed, and don't make other people feel less important than yourself.

## How we think about security

Security is in our blood. For this reason we limit the amount of data we have access to, and share also the very minimum with others, yet still allow to do our jobs. If you feel that security it too paranoia for you, or really restricts you in your work, speak up and discuss it with your manager. Otherwise there are no exceptions for sloppy behavior. We expect all employees to know the [security policy](https://github.com/CISOfy/cisofy-security-policy/). We might perform security tests and test your team, your manager, or you.

## Workplace
There is no reason to have your desk cluttered with papers and other stuff. The brain of humans work best when things are structured and ordered. For this reason a clean desk helps you focusing on the right things, keeping distractions to a minimum.

## Communications
Currently our main communications channel is email and direct calls (via Hangouts, Skype, or phone). Due to development and possible sensitive details we discuss, other communication channels can not be used.

### Email
For email usage the rule is simple: use the official address you received only. No personal accounts or servers are approved for communications with other employees and contractors. Use your work email address for business, your private email address(es) for private matters.

## Productivity
Each individual has a different set of skills and capabilities. We allow flexible work times to give everyone the opportunity to achieve maximum potential from a single day. For this reason we don't have fixed office times. We do however expect people to be responsive to direct team members. Each team has the flexibility to divide the work load. What we do ask is to question regurlarly how you can be at your best. Not just for yourself, but also be a valuable asset to your team. This includes sharing knowledge, or solving a difficult task as a team.

## Meetings
For all internal meetings:
* Be there 5 minutes before start of meeting
* Maximum time of a meeting is 45 minutes
* Agenda should be available at least 24 hours before meeting
* The agenda should contain points of discussion and expected outcomes
* No agenda = no meeting
* One person will take meeting notes

Meetings with customers, partners, and suppliers can take any amount of time. This is allowed to account for questions and that the other party may not be familiar with our strict rules. In any case, take meeting notes and send out an agenda when we are the organizing party.

## Confidentiality
All information received (internally and externally) is considered confidential by default. If you want to allow documents to be used by the general public, mark them as public. This does only apply to non-sensitive information. Always use personal judgement to determine if it warrants to mark something public.

Exception: the website is public by default and does not have to be marked as such. The website however can't serve any confidential data.

## Travel
Travelling can be joy, or a pain. Check first with your manager what we can do regarding travelling and accomodations like hotel nights.
